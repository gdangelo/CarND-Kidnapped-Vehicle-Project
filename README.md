The car has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

The goal of this project is to implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter will also get observation and control data.

## Overview
Starting to work on this project consists of the following steps:


1. Install uWebSocketIO and all the required [dependencies](#installation-and-dependencies)
2. Clone this repository
3. Build the main program 
    - `mkdir build`
    - `cd build`
    - `cmake ..`
    - `make`
4. Launch `./particle_filter`
5. Launch the Udacity Term 2 simulator
6. Enjoy!

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline the build and run parts, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. `./clean.sh`
2. `./build.sh`
3. `./run.sh`

## Directory Structure
The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

```
root
|   build.sh
|   clean.sh
|   CMakeLists.txt
|   README.md
|   run.sh
|
|___data
|   |   
|   |   map_data.txt
|   
|   
|___src
    |   helper_functions.h
    |   main.cpp
    |   map.h
    |   particle_filter.cpp
    |   particle_filter.h
```

The `particle_filter.cpp` file in the `src` directory contains the code for the `ParticleFilter` class and its associated methods. Read through the code, the comments, and the header file `particle_filter.h` to get a sense for what this code is expected to do.

If you are interested, take a look at `src/main.cpp` as well. This file contains the code that will actually be running the particle filter and calling the associated methods.

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map\*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> \* Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.

## Installation and Dependencies

This project involves the Udacity Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.
  
Once all the dependencies have been installed **clone** the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gdangelo/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project
```

and follow the steps 3 to 6 of the [Overview section](#overview) in order to build and run the main program.
